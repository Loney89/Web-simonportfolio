		   <h3>Red King</h3>
		  <p>Red King was a website I produced during my Business Degree, the website used HTML & CSS, I developed this website as a "Mock" site for a business prospect for a Bar & Hotel
		  Chain. The website was also included my first attempt to add Video media to a website, and use branding, colours and some design skills to develop.</p>

		   <h3>The Federation</h3>
		  <p>Federation was a simple website created for a mock Furniture store, it was developed during my first year of my business degree, and is very basic in design, with a menu system
		  incorporated on the left of the screen which worked independently of the rest of the webpage. It used only HTML, with styling hard-coded, it's a very basic website with the focus being
		  mostly on content rather than the website.</p>

		   <h3>The George Inn</h3>
		  <p>The George Inn website was one I created during my BTEC at college. This used much of the same design and code I had developed for the Young Enterprise site. It's a <i>very</i> simple
		  website that used tables for layout design.</p>
