<h2>Online tutor assistant for students</h2>
<p>Welcome to online tutor assistant for students. All registered students and tutors can use this website to access to the services offered by this online system for assistance. By using this website students are allowed to update their personal information as well as arrange an appointment with their chosen tutor by using this online system. This system enables students to make a query to get specific information by using answer garden (e.g. information about a doctor). A FAQ section is also available which answers the questions asked most frequently. </p>
<p>The online system enables tutors to accept or reject an appointment requested by a student. By using this system tutor can view the detail of a student. A students detail includes the personal (e.g. name, address, telephone etc) and academic information (i.e. name and code of the modules a student is enrolled on) of that student. A tutor also might use the system in order to make different queries related to his/her students (i.e. Who is currently suspended? Who has an extension on a particular course work?), download templates for commonly recurring problems (e.g. poor attendance, exam failure etc), retrieve information from FAQ, and use answer garden to get more specific information about a topic.
