		<p>Hi, I'm Simon Nicholls, and if your reading this you're more than likely considering me for a position. This website 
		was created to show of some of the projects I've been involved in; most of which were in a Academic Environment. You 
		can find alot of information about those projects section of the site. </p>

		<p>I'm a Graduated BA Business Studies Student and very soon I'll be a MSc Graduate in Information Technology, with 
		just my dissertation that I'm currently working on to be completed (hand in November 2013), throughout my degree's 
		(Both the Business and IT) I've had a great interest in researching topics related to Social Media Networking, Internet 
		Marketing and Strategy, but as I've progressed I've become more interested in the development of the Web. This is 
		mainly due to some of the great conferences I've attended during 2012 such as the Web Development Conference and the 
		IT megameeting, both situated in the Bristol area. </p>
		
		<p>I've always been greatly interested in the internet and it's many uses, back during my Young Enterprise (2004) we were 
		one of the few companies to produce a website; a very basic one admittedly. I was an early Last.fm, Twitter and Linkedin 
		adotper and other various social networking applications, and an active member of various internet communities.</p>
		
		<p>I've spent the best part of my life doing various Educational/Academic studies. But beside all of that stuff I'm 
		actually just a Massive Geek. I'm an avivd gamer, enjoying games such as Minecraft, Starcraft, League of Legends, 
		Gran Turismo and many many others. This love for gaming mean's i've gotten pretty good at a Hardware level with 
		computer's too, having built my most current computer, and having upgarded various others. Besides the techy stuff, 
		I self taught myself guitar and currently rocking (I use that term loosely) a Epiphone SG guitar mainly enjoy 
		playing Classic Blues and Alternative Rock. I'm a comic book enthusiast; enjoying the likes of Batman and Green Arrow.</p>

		<p>On the odd ocassion that it's actually sunnny and warm in England I also enjoy Football, I was part of a great 5 a-side 
		team during University, but I also enjoy Tennis and Cricket, I greatly enjoy watching Rugby (I don't have the courage to actively 
		play).</p>
		
		<p>Whilst at University I've maintained a job at a nearby Greene King pub, which whilst not boasting great IT experience; it
		has taught me the importance of team work & interpersonal skills. It's mostly seasonal and in Season a very demanding workplace, 
		but I've never let this get to me, If anything i'm actually very good at handling the stress and working through it. 
		However, the combination of being a developer, geek & working in a bar in Somerset means I've learnt the wonders of Cider. </p>
