		   <h3>The Federation</h3>
		  <p>Federation was a simple website created for a mock Furniture store, it was developed during my first year of my business degree, and is very basic in design, with a menu system
		  incorporated on the left of the screen which worked independently of the rest of the webpage. It used only HTML, with styling hard-coded, it's a very basic website with the focus being
		  mostly on content rather than the website.</p>

		  website that used tables for layout design.</p>
